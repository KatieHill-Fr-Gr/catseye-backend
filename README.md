## About

Catseye is a translation and project management app intended for business users who create and manage multilingual content. In my previous roles as a translator and copywriter, I used many CAT (Computer Assisted Translation) and workflow management tools that had clunky and outdated UIs. I wanted to design and build an agile and streamlined app that combined these functionalities in a simple and intuitive way, while also fostering collaboration between teams.

This was my final project on the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. Our brief was to develop a full-stack application using a Python Django API and PostgreSQL for data management. These technologies are ideal for data-heavy apps like translation tools, which rely on structured data and complex relationships. Combining this with workflow management (projects and tasks) made this a challenging build. However, I managed to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by the deadline and have since continued to fix bugs and work on additional features.
